# Safe Cracking Algorithm

This was an interview question I received from a (very) large tech company.

### Problem:  
Given an unending string of numbers, attempt to brute force your way into a safe.
Constraints: Code must be a 4 digit number, and must not have been used before.  4 digit number is generated by removing the 1st digit in the number and adding the first digit in the string to the remaining.

### Example:
```
      1234    5678910
1 <-  234     5678910
      2345 <- 67891011
```

### Solution:
**Data Structures:**  Trie or Binary Search Tree.  (For a good resource on Tires, click [here](https://medium.com/basecs/trying-to-understand-tries-3ec6bede0014) ).

**Random Number Generator:** Created class called *Random* that takes a RNG as a template and handles the RNG generation.   This example uses *std::minstd_rand* but can handle *Mersenne* and *Mersenne 64bit*. (Step is not necessary, but generates a better RN than using rand()).
