#Safe Cracking Algorithm

This was an interview question I received from a (very) large tech company.

Problem:  Given an unending string of numbers, attempt to brute force your way into a safe.
Constraints: Code must be a 4 digit number, and must not have been used before.  4 digit number is generated by removing the 1st digit in the number and adding the first digit in the string to the remaining.

Example:
 1234      5678910
1 <-  234    5678910
2345    <-  67891011
